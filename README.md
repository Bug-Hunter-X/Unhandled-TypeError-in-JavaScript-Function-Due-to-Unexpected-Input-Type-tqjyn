# Unhandled TypeError in JavaScript Function Due to Unexpected Input Type

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: an unhandled `TypeError` caused by a function making assumptions about the type of its input.  The `foo` function assumes its input is either an array or a string; however, it does not handle cases where the input is `undefined` or of an unexpected type. This results in a runtime error.  The solution demonstrates robust error handling to prevent this type of error.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.
4. Execute the JavaScript files in a Node.js environment (or a browser's console) to see the error and the corrected output.

## Bug

The original code fails to handle the case when the input (`x`) is `undefined`. Accessing `x.length` when `x` is `undefined` throws a `TypeError`.

## Solution

The solution adds an explicit check for `undefined` before attempting to access `x.length`. If `x` is `undefined`, the function returns a default value (or throws a more informative error, depending on the desired behavior).
